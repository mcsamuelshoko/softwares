          <p>
            Beyond code, I am a Graphic designer who values both purpose and appearance. I combine my technical skills with design thinking to create great solutions. I enjoy building lasting products that solve real problems. <br>
            <br>
            When I'm not building software, you'll find me: <br>
            — Exploring emerging tech trends and best practices <br>
            — Learning from engineering podcasts and conference talks <br>
            — Designing digital products and experiences <br>
            — Gaming and creating content to stay creative <br>
            <br>
            My approach is pragmatic: write maintainable code, solve real problems, and keep learning. I want my work to hit hard and make a difference.
